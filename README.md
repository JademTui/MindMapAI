# MindMap AI

MindMap AI is a modular, extensible, and robust AI system for collaborative mind mapping, knowledge discovery, and intelligent agent interaction.

---

## Overview
MindMap AI consists of specialized agents, a user dashboard, API endpoints, and supporting modules for learning, reasoning, and analytics. It is designed for scalability, security, and developer extensibility.

## Features
- Modular agent architecture (arts, science, engineering, health, finance, etc.)
- Robust error handling, input validation, and secure logging
- Real undo/redo and search log aggregation in UserDashboard
- FastAPI-based API endpoints for agent and dashboard actions
- Snapshot and analytics features
- Extensible feedback and knowledge graph systems
- UI/UX dashboard for users

## Agent Architecture
- Each agent specializes in a domain and follows best practices for robustness and security.
- Agents support learning, reasoning, question generation, and log aggregation.
- All agent modules are equipped with docstrings, type hints, and secure logging.

## API
- RESTful endpoints via FastAPI
- Endpoints for: dashboard actions (undo/redo/snapshot/logs), agent queries, analytics, etc.
- API key validation and error handling throughout

## Testing & Quality Assurance
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all agent workflows, state management, and API endpoints
- Use `pytest` or `unittest` for Python modules
- Test undo/redo, snapshot, and log aggregation features
- Automated tests are required for all new code

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- GitHub Actions pipeline runs tests and lints code on every commit
- All PRs must pass CI before merge

## Security & Compliance
- All inputs validated; secure logging practices to avoid sensitive data leaks
- API keys required for protected endpoints
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Dependabot/Snyk (see [Security Policy](docs/SECURITY.md))
- API endpoints implement rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for sensitive actions and access
- Privacy Policy for web/API users: see [Privacy Policy](docs/PRIVACY_POLICY.md)
- Accessibility: UI is designed to meet WCAG standards

## Performance
- Designed for scalability with efficient file I/O and log management
- Profile agent reasoning and dashboard analytics for bottlenecks
- Async patterns and batching can be introduced for high-load scenarios

## UI/UX
- Dashboard provides user-friendly access to agent features, logs, and analytics
- Error messages, loading states, and visualizations recommended for best experience

## Extensibility
- Add new agents by following the agent module template
- Plugin and extension points available for new data sources or behaviors
- Configuration via files or admin UI

## Feedback & Analytics
- Feedback store and analytics dashboard for continuous improvement
- Aggregate and visualize agent/user feedback

## Getting Started
### Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. (Optional) Install additional modules: `pip install -r requirements_semantic_memory.txt`
4. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file as required.
5. Run the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
6. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8000` (if enabled).

### Usage
- Interact with agents via the dashboard or API endpoints.
- See the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.
- For developers, see [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).

### Troubleshooting
- Review logs in the `/logs` directory or dashboard.
- For common issues and solutions, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Contributing
- Follow code style and documentation standards (see [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md))
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for new features
- Submit PRs for review
- All contributions must pass CI checks and code review
